                Max’s journey began in karting, where he dominated international championships.
                By 17, he had already reached Formula 1 — something never seen before.
            </p>

            <p>
                His first Red Bull victory came in 2016, making him the youngest race winner in history.
                From that moment, the world knew a superstar had arrived.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since then, Max has built a dynasty with Red Bull Racing, winning consecutive
                world titles and delivering some of the most dominant seasons in F1 history.
